## What I've learned.
- I learned to use states in react.
- I learned to pass data from a container to a component.
- I learned to call functions from a container through a component.
- I learned to use map & filter functions to add, update and remove items from an array.
- I learned the diference between mutable and unmutable data changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
